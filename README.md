# svelte-cookie-consent

`A user friendly way to ask for consent`

I could not find a good solution for my SvelteKit project, where i could ask a user for tracking and advertising consent. So i made one.

**⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA, BUGS AND ERRORS ARE EXPECTED ⚠️**

You can install it, right from NPM

    npm i @manchtools/svelte-cookie-consent@latest
